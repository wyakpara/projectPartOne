  <h1>Meal Preparation Tips</h1>
  <p>
    Here are some helpful tips for meal prepping:
    <ul>
      <li>It's much easier with a partner. Typically, one person chops and does small
        tasks while the other takes point on the full meals themselves. If you're not working with a partner,
        consider doing your chopping ahead of time. </li>
      <li>Commit a couple of hours to this! Home cooked meals take effort, but they're well worth it.
        The idea behind meal prepping is that you take a solid chunk of time to prepare all your meals for the week. </li>
      <li>Invest in some good tupperware, especially if you want to take your meals for lunch during the day. </li>
      <li>Keep some easy-to-make food around for when you get tired of whatever meals you've made that week.
        Something like spaghetti or frozen pizza can be an easy change of pace mid-week that doesn't take
        a lot of time to prep. </li>
    </ul>
