      <h1>Meal Preparation Tips</h1>
      Here are some helpful tips for meal prepping:
      <ul>
        <li>It's much easier with a partner. Typically, one person chops and does small
          tasks while the other takes point on the full meals themselves. If you're not working with a partner,
          consider doing your chopping ahead of time. </li>
        <li>Commit a couple of hours to this! Home cooked meals take effort, but they're well worth it.
          The idea behind meal prepping is that you take a solid chunk of time to prepare all your meals for the week. </li>
        <li>Invest in some good tupperware, especially if you want to take your meals for lunch during the day. </li>
        <li>Keep some easy-to-make food around for when you get tired of whatever meals you've made that week.
          Something like spaghetti or frozen pizza can be an easy change of pace mid-week that doesn't take
          a lot of time to prep. </li>
      </ul>
