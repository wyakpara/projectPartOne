        Medical school is hard. Eating right and staying healthy is hard.  Doing
        both is practically impossible! <br><br>
        But it <i>is</i> possible. When eating healthy home-cooked meals became
          prohibitively time-consuming for us to do on a daily basis, we started
          meal-prepping.<br><br>
      </p>
          <h2>What is meal-prepping?</h2>
      <p>
        Meal prepping is exactly what it sounds like.  You prepare meals ahead of
        time, usually on the weekends and in preparation for the whole week. We find
        that it works best to prepare two meals at a time, and all of these recipes
        assume that two people are going to be eating these meals.
